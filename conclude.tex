\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclude}

The current state of the system is as follows:
the physical installation is complete,
the individual motor control software is complete and operational,
and a number of variations on the global control MDP are being investigated.
Extensions to the MDP that we are
considering include: multiple motors in simultaneous motion, multi-step
transitions that include acceleration profiles, and model reduction
techniques to diminish the inevitable state-space explosion.
